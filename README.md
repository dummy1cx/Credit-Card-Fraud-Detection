# Credit card fraud detection using neural networks

When discussing financial transactions and consumer security on digital platforms, the current market is defined by everyday credit card purchases, which contributes to a signi- ficant increase in different types of fraud. Considering these perspectives, the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset was chosen to be used in order to understand the process behind this application standard used by global companies. Therefore, the aim of Task 1 is to develop a neural network for credit card fraud detection by understanding the pattern of fraudulent activities.
